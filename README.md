## Project Structure
I'm following a Hexagonal, Domain-driven structure. The tldr; is that it gives you inversion of control (IoC) and a clear separation of concerns between the different domains within your application. Makes for easy testing, easy to change (clear seams), and great readability. Check out [Kat Zien's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL6JBUk6tj0&t=1614s) for more info.
